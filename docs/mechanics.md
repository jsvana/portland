mechanics are possibilities.

## Condescention

life decisions, walk away, and possibly cry.

## Beard Punch

Upon acquiring the Beard of Destiny, the player can punch enemies with his
rockin' beard.

## Plaid Ray

The player shoots enemies and turns them into fellow hipsters to aid him.

## Throwing Records

The player throws vinyls at the enemy, hurting them. Can upgrade to
colored vinyls to cause more damage.

## Weird Music Distraction

The player uses his enormous library of weird indie music to temporarily
disable or distract enemies.
